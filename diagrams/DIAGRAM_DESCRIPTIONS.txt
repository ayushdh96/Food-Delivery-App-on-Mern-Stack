MERMAID DIAGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
============================

This document provides concise descriptions for all the Mermaid diagrams created for the Food Delivery Application.

---

1. SEQUENCE DIAGRAM 1: AUTHENTICATION (sequence-1-authentication.mmd)
   
   This diagram illustrates the user authentication flows including registration, login, and logout processes.
   It shows how the frontend interacts with the backend API to create new user accounts with encrypted passwords,
   authenticate existing users with JWT tokens, and handle logout by clearing the authentication state.


2. SEQUENCE DIAGRAM 2: BROWSE & CART (sequence-2-browse-cart.mmd)
   
   This diagram captures the core shopping experience flows: browsing the food catalog, adding items to cart,
   and removing items from cart. It demonstrates how the application fetches food items from the database,
   updates the cart state both locally and on the server, and maintains cart persistence for logged-in users.


3. SEQUENCE DIAGRAM 3: ORDERS & STRIPE PAYMENT (sequence-3-orders-stripe.mmd)
   
   This diagram details the order placement and payment processing flows. It shows the Stripe integration for
   online payments including session creation and payment verification, the cash-on-delivery alternative flow,
   and how users can view their order history with real-time status updates.


4. SEQUENCE DIAGRAM 4: ADMIN FOOD MANAGEMENT (sequence-4-admin-food.mmd)
   
   This diagram represents the administrative functions for managing the food catalog. It illustrates how
   administrators can add new food items with image uploads using Multer, view the complete list of available
   items, and remove items from the database when needed.


5. SEQUENCE DIAGRAM 5: ADMIN ORDER MANAGEMENT (sequence-5-admin-orders.mmd)
   
   This diagram shows the order management workflow from the administrator's perspective. It demonstrates
   how admins can view all customer orders with their details and update order statuses (e.g., from "Food Processing"
   to "Out for delivery" to "Delivered") to keep customers informed about their order progress.


6. CLASS DIAGRAM: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (class-diagram.mmd)
   
   This comprehensive class diagram depicts the complete system architecture including all models, controllers,
   context providers, and components. It shows the relationships between MongoDB models (User, Food, Order),
   backend controllers handling business logic, the React context managing global state, and the frontend/admin
   components. The diagram includes attributes, methods, and multiplicity relationships to provide a complete
   structural view of the application.
